                Update of progress:


Annie
  - completed the functionality for viewing current listing per seller:
	- html page completed
	- added "edit listing" functionality which connects to "editlisting.php", which 	will replace "newlisting.php". Edit listing uses the same UI as new listing.
	- added "remove listing" functionality which connects to "removelisting.php"
	- added button to go to bid event
  - updated product.php
	- standardised date format (Y-m-d)
	- changed actionable in $_POST from 0/1 to Yes/No to avoid empty error
  - updated product.csv
	- changed the date format (Y-m-d) to match with product.php
  - created new script to store all condition and category names and indices as session 	variables to facilitate use
  - completed selling history

                Aims / todo:

Annie

Darren
    from annie:
    - sellinghistory.php: plz include query/function to fetch buyer info


Haow Jern
    from annie:
    - sellershop.php: plz include the codes for image and bid events 
    - product.php: resolve merge conflicts
    - editlisting.php (previous newlisting.php): not sure if there's any conflict regarding the image


Sergi
    
    check emails send (when bidmake & bidend)
    add subject body etc to emails

    finish watchlist table

    ./ - when bid make, update users watching AND users that have made bids
    .  - when bid end, update users watching AND users that have made bids 

    ? - search bar sql search 

    - show watchlist table make good



    ( - ensure user can't make watch on same item more than once !!! <- this is solved by watch->stopwatching button)
    - read up on sessions, etc 
    ( ??- sellinghistory.php, fetcharchive.php: should be very similar to your buyer purchase 	history!!   [<- from annie] )

    - make watchlist function(s) - ready to plug onto relevant pages (figure out where they'd go - listing page defo, any others?)

    - which functions?
        
        watchlist:
        
            ./  add_watching                
            ./  1   remove_watching         [put buttons into view-item and show_my_watchlist pages]
            .   2   update_all_watchers     function as part of making a bid! if bid > any bid made by user watching !
            .   3   show_my_watchlist       ...needs specific product sql

        
        search for item kinds & categories:

            search_items    [is this done by annie? do i have to do selling history? check...]
        
    
    - current code that's relevant:


            make:
        buyer_item      (watch button!)
        Buyer_listing   (search & filter by category/condition) ?
        selling_history         (? search & filter by category/condition?) ?


            using:
        fetch_archive   [gets the archive listings of the seller]
        getc&c.php      [gets condition and category]


    - creating:
        
        ./watch_product.php
        ./activity/watch_product_interface.php

        ./show_my_watchlist     shows all the items that user is watching

         functions:
        stop watching button (when user is watching the item being viewed in buyer listing)
        email all watchers (when bid made)



    - question... are users searching & filtering by KEYWORDS as well as category & condition?
