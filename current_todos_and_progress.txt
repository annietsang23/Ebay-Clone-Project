                Update of progress:


Annie
  - completed the functionality for viewing current listing per seller:
	- html page completed
	- added "edit listing" functionality which connects to "editlisting.php", which 	will replace "newlisting.php". Edit listing uses the same UI as new listing.
	- added "remove listing" functionality which connects to "removelisting.php"
	- added button to go to bid event
  - updated product.php
	- standardised date format (Y-m-d)
	- changed actionable in $_POST from 0/1 to Yes/No to avoid empty error
  - updated product.csv
	- changed the date format (Y-m-d) to match with product.php
  - created new script to store all condition and category names and indices as session 	variables to facilitate use
  - completed selling history
