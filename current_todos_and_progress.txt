    - See list of product details depending on what I searched for.                 #### Sergi - search by catgry/condtn

   annie: changed code logic so can now use fetchactivelisting.php based on search criteria:
            - category
            - auctionable
            - all
    can add more criteria but need to consider the search efficiency (maybe it's easier to do further filtering on client side)
    #############
    - Filter what I see.                                                            #### Sergi - as above and see Annie's note below

                Update of progress:


Annie
  - completed the functionality for viewing current listing per seller:
	- html page completed
	- added "edit listing" functionality which connects to "editlisting.php", which 	will replace "newlisting.php". Edit listing uses the same UI as new listing.
	- added "remove listing" functionality which connects to "removelisting.php"
	- added button to go to bid event
  - updated product.php
	- standardised date format (Y-m-d)
	- changed actionable in $_POST from 0/1 to Yes/No to avoid empty error
  - updated product.csv
	- changed the date format (Y-m-d) to match with product.php
  - created new script to store all condition and category names and indices as session 	variables to facilitate use
  - completed selling history

	

Darren


Haow Jern
    - Created single product page to display to buyer - buyer_item.php 
    - Linked bidding functionality. 

    - Will create a listing page for buyers similar to what annie has done and i'll join it up with buyer_item to test things out.

                Aims / todo:

Annie

Darren
    from annie:
    - sellinghistory.php: plz include query/function to fetch buyer info


Haow Jern
    from annie:
    - sellershop.php: plz include the codes for image and bid events 
    - product.php: resolve merge conflicts
    - editlisting.php (previous newlisting.php): not sure if there's any conflict regarding the image


Sergi
    - sellinghistory.php, fetcharchive.php: should be very similar to your buyer purchase 	history!!   [<- from annie]

    - make watchlist function(s) - ready to plug onto relevant pages (figure out where they'd go - listing page defo, any others?)

    - work out what people have coded (that would be relevant to my functions)
    - work out how to go about coding my functions
    - work out how to code each function

    - which functions?
        
        watchlist:

            add_watching
            remove_watching
            update_all_watchers
        
        search for item kinds & categories:

            search_items
        
    
    - current code that's relevant:


            make:
        buyer_item      (watch button!)
        Buyer_listing   (search & filter by category/condition)
        selling_history         (? search & filter by category/condition?)


            using:
        fetch_archive   [gets the archive listings of the seller]
        getc&c.php      [gets condition and category]


    - creating:
        
        watch_product.php       take a few hints from bid_product.php - and bid_product_interface.php



    - question... are users searching & filtering by KEYWORDS as well as category & condition? 
    - qu... what exactly is "home.jpg" in notes above? and why all .jpg/.png ???
